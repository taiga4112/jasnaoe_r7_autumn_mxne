	abstract = {This paper presents a review of the different International Maritime Organization ({IMO}) initiatives to improve the ship energy efficiency of new and existing ships, which is considered one of the essential tasks to reduce Greenhouse Gas ({GHG}) in the maritime industry. First, the {IMO} effort and initiatives and the different indices suggested by the {IMO} are presented till the last version of the Marine Environment Protection Committee ({MEPC}), showing the effect of different technologies on reducing the level of indices and the suggested improvement of the terms of indices in the next years. Second, the short- and long-term strategies suggested by the {IMO} are presented, showing that the effect of indices will be noticed in the short term, while the new fuels will show a significant improvement in the long term. Finally, several examples of cooperation between the different organizations are presented, showing that transferring knowledge and experience will significantly impact the maritime industry and thus lead to the concept of green ships in the near future. This paper shows that the combination of different solutions, the cooperation between stakeholders and the sharing of the data and information are important to achieve the required goal.},

ABSTRACT = {Global maritime transportation is responsible for around 3% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and significant proportions of SOx, NOx, and PM emissions. Considering the predicted growth in shipping volumes to 2050, greenhouse gas emissions from ships must be cut by 75–85% per ton-mile to meet Paris Agreement goals. This study reviews the potential of a range of alternative fuels for decarbonisation in maritime. A systematic literature review and information synthesis method was applied to evaluate fuel characteristics, production pathways, utilization technologies, energy efficiency, lifecycle environmental performance, economic viability, and current applicable policies. Alternative fuels are essential to decarbonisation in international shipping. However, findings suggest there is no single route to deliver the required greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Emissions reductions vary widely depending on the production pathways of the fuel. Alternative fuels utilising a carbon-intensive production pathway will not provide decarbonisation, instead shifting emissions elsewhere in the supply chain. Ultimately, a system-wide perspective to creating an effective policy framework is required in order to promote the adoption of alternative propulsion technologies.},

abstract = {The environmental problems brought by the shipping industry have drawn the attention of all parties, making it critical to select a fuel system that combines economic and environmental benefits when ordering new ships. This paper narrows down a list of fuels to four high-potential options: LNG, methanol, hydrogen, and ammonia. Based on the dual perspectives of shipowners and the public, this study takes different-sized ships as the object, establishes mathematical models throughout their life cycle, and selects a variety of indicators to evaluate alternative fuels. The findings demonstrate that, in the short term, heavy fuel oil with scrubbers is the most economically advantageous option for all sizes of container ships, but methanol is a desirable alternative when taking into account the social cost of pollutants. Hydrogen might be the ultimate fuel to reduce emissions in the long run when the price gap closes.}

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the use of nuclear energy as propulsion for merchant ships has been proposed as a means of promoting the transition toward maritime decarbonization and environmentally sustainable shipping. However, there are concerns that nuclear-powered merchant ships could pose risks to the marine environment in the event of accidents, such as collisions, machinery failure or damage, fire, or explosions. The current international regulatory framework for nuclear-powered merchant ships is insufficient to address these risks. This research aims to address this gap by conducting a policy analysis of the existing regulations and a critical examination of their effectiveness in addressing the environmental risks of nuclear-powered merchant ships. Through this analysis, the study identifies the shortcomings and insufficiencies in the current framework and explores potential solutions to improve it, with the goal of enhancing the international community’s ability to mitigate the potential impacts of radioactive marine pollution from nuclear-propelled ships in an era of maritime decarbonization.},

ABSTRACT = {Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) offer transformative potential for maritime propulsion by providing significant benefits such as reduced emissions, enhanced fuel efficiency, and greater operational autonomy. However, their integration into the maritime sector presents complex regulatory challenges due to the convergence of nuclear and maritime laws. A unified, harmonized regulatory framework is essential to ensure safety, radioactive waste management, and accident prevention. While initiatives led by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and International Maritime Organization (IMO) are progressing, key gaps remain, particularly regarding maritime-specific risk assessments, emergency response protocols, and cross-border regulatory harmonization. Enhanced collaboration between regulatory bodies, pilot projects, and transparent engagement with stakeholders will be critical to refining safety protocols and accelerating regulatory alignment. Public acceptance remains a vital factor, requiring rigorous environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and transparent communication to build trust and align SMR-powered vessels with global sustainability objectives. While challenges persist, they also present opportunities for innovation and international cooperation. By addressing these regulatory and public acceptance challenges through coordinated efforts and policies, SMR propulsion can become a cornerstone of a more sustainable, efficient, and technologically advanced maritime sector. Successful deployment will position SMRs as a key component of the global energy transition, driving progress toward low-carbon shipping and a greener maritime industry.},

abstract = {The utilization of alternative fuels such as LNG, methanol, hydrogen, ammonia, and nuclear energy on marine vessels is quite critical to cope with the challenging air pollution regulations set by IMO and to realize global de-carbonization strategies. Nuclear energy has come to the fore with high and sustainable energy density as well as a carbon-free feature among the other potential alternative maritime fuels. Nuclear energy has been used successfully for icebreakers, submarines, and naval vessels up to now and it has been researched for commercial ships, despite a few unsuccessful projects because nuclear energy brings certain difficulties during its utilization, especially in commercial ships. That’s why a SWOT analysis has been performed to determine all internal and external factors on the utilization of nuclear energy in commercial ships as a maritime fuel. The SWOT factors and sub-factors have been established with the aid of comparable energy studies in the literature and maritime sector reports. Twelve marine experts with an average of 12.8 years of experience have participated in a survey to determine the priority weight of each main and sub-factors. Opportunity and strength aspects have the highest weight with 0.362 and 0.302 respectively. On the other hand, threats have a substantial amount of weight with 0.212. Being eco-friendly, reducing dependency on fossil fuels, and preventing fuel fluctuations constitute the three most prominent features among the sub-factors. However, safety and security challenges, which are 4th place among the sub-factors, should be eliminated as much as possible for successful applications of nuclear energy. Experience gathered from past and existing nuclear-powered marine vessels will have been beneficial to overcome difficulties in the utilization of nuclear energy in commercialships.}

Furthermore, these optimal designs contain uncertainties in terms of the evaluation parameters and design conditions, thereby raising the issue of robustness of the design idea that the designer needs to investigate to arrive at a decision for building the expensive structure of a ship. This paper proposes a method to organize and visualize the propulsive performance of any number of hull form combinations. The shape morphing technique, which has been limited to the blending of two or three hull forms, is extended to the shape morphing of N hull forms by introducing the concept of the barycentric coordinate system. Thus, a hull-form coordinate system with each hull form as a basis is proposed. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by analyzing several hull-form design spaces. This method can contribute to improving the robustness of the optimal solution obtained by nonlinear optimization and machine learning, by analyzing and visualizing the design space around the optimal point.},

The design of such social infrastructure requires sociotechnical evaluation, including the identification of the different needs of multiple stakeholders. This study designs and proposes concepts for data center systems as integrated infrastructure consisting of both data center and green power plant in response to rapid regional growth and potential of offshore and nearshore infrastructure in Southeast Asia. To design such an infrastructure involving multiple stakeholders with differing needs, a systems approach is employed to analyze stakeholder values and system functions leads to the identification of key stakeholders and system requirements. Subsequently, a quantitative multi-objective model based on prioritized stakeholder needs and system requirements was developed to comprehensively evaluate the data center design tradespace. Simulation results of multiple location across the region imply that Singapore is an attractive location for investment given an offshore data center with an offshore fixed wind power plant that can contribute to a 50\% reduction in scaling difficulty and a 50\% reduction in lifetime {CO}2 emissions compared to onshore data centers with solar plants, while 5\% increase of total investment.},
